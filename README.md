**1. How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**

I can ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure by following the standard industry guidelines. To make my code, program, or software functional, I can write clear and concise codes to make it easier to read and maintainable. Using techniques such as input validations can help make the code more secure by confirmation the system will handle positive and negative inputs correctly.

**2. How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**

The first step is to understand the user's vision. By understanding the user's needs and wants I will be able to create a code that aligns. The next step would be to test and iterate to ensure the application is working properly.

**3. How do I approach designing software?**

I approached designing software by using the S.M.A.R.T. (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound) framework. The SMART framework applies to all situations, including software designing, and can provide a sense of direction, increasing the quality and performance of the software. After implementing the design, the following approach to designing software tests all various components when implemented into the system. Testing early on or frequently will help to detect issues before deployment.
